        <p class="font2"><br>The Virginia Wildlife Management and Control's Snake Identification Hotline was recently
            contacted about a strange-looking snake. With its half-moon shaped head, the snake stumped experts, who
            admitted that they had never seen anything like it before.
            <br>According to Virginia Wildlife Management and Control, the reptile was found in Midlothian.
            They described it as 10 to 12 inches long in a Facebook post asking for the public's help in identifying the
            snake. "The problem is, we've never seen anything like it before and we're not sure if it's a freak of
            nature, like the 2 headed copperhead, that we were involved with, a few years ago.</p>

        <p class="font2"><br>According to Live Science, hammerhead worms are notoriously difficult to kill. They can
            regenerate from even small amputated bits of their bodies.

            <br>"It is called a shovelhead worm or hammerhead worm, it's invasive it will kill our earthworms," wrote
            one
            Facebook user, while others suggested putting the worm in salt or vinegar.

            <br>According to the Texas Invasive Species Institute, it is believed that hammerhead worms entered the US
            decades ago. They were apparently brought into the country with horticultural plants and have been regularly
            found in greenhouses since 1901. </p>

        <p class="font2"><br>The Wildlife Conservation 20 - or WC20 - will be the first time the conservation sector has
            convened in such large numbers ahead of a G20 meeting to seek to present, with one voice, a single
            declaration containing key recommendations for G20 leaders, who will meet just two days later.

            <br>This year’s G20 - the world’s premier forum for international economic cooperation - is taking place on
            21-22 November in Riyadh.

            The WC20 intends to bring together the leaders of 20 prominent wildlife conservation NGOs who are at the
            forefront of protecting nature, including the world's most iconic and rare wildlife species. </p>

        <p class="font2"><br>Ahead of the event, a draft declaration has been circulated to attendees to gain input on
            the core themes that G20 governments must address. This includes areas such as law enforcement, demand
            reduction and local community support.”

            At today’s event it is intended that the WC20 will create a final agreed list of recommendations to the G20.

            The WC20 Declaration would then become the basis of a sustained advocacy effort in 2021, including at G7,
            CBD, COP, Expo and Davos. </p>
